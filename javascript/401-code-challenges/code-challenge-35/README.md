# Graph

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

add node
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph
add edge
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
get nodes
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
Empty collection returned if there are no nodes
get neighbors
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Empty collection returned if there are no nodes
size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
0 if there are none

## Test
to run the test, type in "npm test code-challenge-35"

## Approach & Efficiency
Console logs, bing, stackoverflow, reading Jeffreys code, as well as Brookes.
