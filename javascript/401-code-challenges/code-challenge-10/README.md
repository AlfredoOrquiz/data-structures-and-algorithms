# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
